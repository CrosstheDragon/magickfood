        an answer. </p>
        <p>Bears are closely identified with herbal medical systems. A popular magical theory regarding how people acquired herbal knowledge is that bears taught it to us.</p>

        <h3><i>Tools Needed</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pillow</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><i>Ingredients Needed</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Portrait of a bear's head</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><u><i>Instructions</i></u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>You will need a full-frontal image of a bear's head, a sort of portrait, although a photograph of a real bear is more powerful than a drawing. Whether the rest of the bear is in the photo is irrelevant. 
                The crucial element is that you can look directly into the bear's eyes. </li>
            <li> Just before turning out the lights to go to sleep, gaze into the image bear's eyes. Take your time. Treat this as a meditation. 
                In your mind, elucidate what information you require, while continuing to gaze into the bear's eyes.</li>
            <li>When you feel ready, place the image under your pillow; turn out the light and go to sleep.</li>
            <li>Insights and inspiration sent by the bears, although you may not necessarily see the bears, should emerge in your dreams. Repeat as needed. </li>
        </ol>
        <i>Note:Action on behalf of bears' welfare and habitat may enhance chances of success or serve as a reciprocal gesture. </i>
       <br>
        <i>Extra note:Perhaps you'd like a more direct approach. Well, it's not advisable to directly approach bears. Contact with humans typically ends in tragedy for person and bear alike. 
            However, dreams permit access not possible in waking life.</i>
