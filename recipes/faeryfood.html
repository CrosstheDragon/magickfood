        <h2><u>Faery Food</u></h2>
        <p>Food meant to attract faeries into your home. It's  bread.</p>
        <p>Note: This recipe is from the book, <cite>The Book of Faeries</cite> by Francis Melville.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "Faeries love food, particularly dairy products, bread, cakes, and cookies. 
            To make the faery food below, it is best to use organize and unprocessed ingredients if possible." <sup>1</sup>

        <h3><i>Tools Needed</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stirring spoon</li>
            <li>Small saucepan (to hold at least one cup of liquid) </li>
            <li>A stovetop or campfire</li>
            <li>Somewhere to bake food</li>
            <li>Baking sheet or pan</li>
            <li>Somewhere to place hot baking sheet or pan on</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><i>Ingredients </i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 oz (90 g) porridge oats</li>
            <li>3 oz (90 g) mixed seeds (sesame, poppy, sunflower, or others)</li>
            <li>1 oz (30 g) chopped hazelnuts</li>
            <li>1 oz (30 g) condensed milk</li>
            <li>2 oz (60 g) honey</li>
            <li>3 oz (90 g) butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><u><i>Baking Insructions</i></u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the honey, milk, and butter in a saucepan.</li>
            <li>Once melted, remove from the heat and stir in the remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Press the mixture firmly into a shallow, well-greased, 8-in (20 cm) square baking pan
                and place in the oven at 350 degree Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius/ gas mark 4) for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool, then cut into small squares while still warm.</li>
            <li>Leave the food out for the faeries to enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>Do not worry if the food you leave out does not appear to have been eaten.
            Being only semi-corporeal at most, faeries seldom actually consume the body of the food.
            Rather, they extract its essence. Faery food should therefore be discarded after a day, because
            it will have little nutritional value left.<sup>1</sup></p>
        <p><small>Developer's note: Or you can eat the bread as a reward for feeding faeries. :-D</small></p>
